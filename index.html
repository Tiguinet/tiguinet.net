                We Were Tiguinet. A small Non-Profit Internet Transit/Peering Provider.<br>
                We provided numerous services that include : Transit, Resource sponsoring, VM's and why not more
                (propose)<br>
                As we were non-profit, we did not have a lot of capacity and only provide to non-profit legal projects
                (if you
                offer beer ;-) ).<br><br>
                PS: No IPv6 = No transit for you ;-) <br><br>
                (as you can see, we currently don't do webdesign... But if you want to help... :) )

                Due to the project getting lost in his target and the high price of operating costs, we decided to put
                an end to our activities on 01/February/2021. We learned a lot while operating. From the network up to
                the application layer to automate our systems. We also had a arch linux, openwrt and MX linux mirror.
                This one stays operating today (as to not force people to change their settings and also because it's a
                system that requires very low maintenance)<br><br>
                Thank you to everyone that made this possible :-). See you maybe on another project one day.
